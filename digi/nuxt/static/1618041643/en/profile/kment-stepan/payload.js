How can the Czech Republic get inspired abroad? A review of literature shows that differences in knowledge between disadvantaged pupils and their classmates increase by about a third during the closure of schools. Why is the Czech Republic unable to identify children in need and collect data to ensure equitable education? And why will the neglect of effective reduction of educational inequalities affect schools mainly after the pandemic? In addition, Czech teachers played a number of different caring roles during the pandemic, and yet we are unable to grasp the fundamental social functions that schools have performed and continue to perform in communities. Appreciating them now, as well as in the future when students return to full-time teaching, would have a noticeable effect on the wellbeing of children and teachers.",videoLink:"https:\u002F\u002Fyoutu.be\u002FEdAkgemWgXs",toc:[],body:{type:"root",children:[{type:"element",tag:"p",props:{},children:[{type:"text",value:"Štěpán has a degree from Education Studies at UCL and he is currently doing\na related Master’s at the University of Cambridge.
