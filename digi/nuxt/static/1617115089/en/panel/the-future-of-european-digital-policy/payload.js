In this session we will discuss Tech waves, why is it all different with AI, and outline a few AI Power Principles that show how the paradigm is being changed. We will capture the state of play and forecast trends vis-a-vis the global race for AI Dominance between the dramatis personae: states, corporations, start-ups, and AI stewards. We will put a specific emphasis on the geopolitics of AI. Via a comparative analysis of emerging visions & models in AI Policy, Regulation, and Governance, focusing on EU, US, China et al. we will discuss challenges with AI Policy and cite trends and suggested approaches based on global use cases and forward-thinking AI Policy projects of note. We close with envisioning the AI State (opportunities and red flags both) and envision new frameworks for community steering of AI Purpose and adoption through a global lens.",toc:[],body:{type:a,children:[{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:d,value:"Senior global innovation and AI expert,\na conduit between the US and Europe and trusted advisor to the C-suite in all sectors,\nspecializing in AI Strategy, Ethics, Impact, Talent, Policy, and Governance.\nGeorge is the co-author of BetweenBrains: Taking Back our AI Future, a 2020 book."}]}]},dir:e,path:"\u002Fen\u002Fpanel\u002Fthe-future-of-european-digital-policy\u002Fprofile-george-tilesch",extension:f,createdAt:g,updatedAt:"2020-12-02T21:35:40.579Z"},{slug:"profile-kolaja-marcel",title:"Marcel Kolaja",image:"kolaja-marcel.jpg",videoDescription:"The Digital Services Act is a long-awaited piece of legislation reforming the basic rules of the internet in Europe.

Using digital political advertising as example, I will address gaps in the current approach and recommend where additional and more efficient steps should be taken. The intervention will focus primarily on the European Democracy Action Plan (EUDAP) but partially also DSA, which represent a new opportunity for the future of European regulation, if approached right, and for the promotion of the concept of digital sovereignty and standard-setting on the world stage. I will elaborate on wider context of the issue, including the current US state of play, national EU Member States contributions, approaches taken by the social media platforms themselves, and the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing “infodemic”.",videoLink:"https:\u002F\u002Fyoutu.be\u002Fq5GJmniQHNM",toc:[],body:{type:a,children:[{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:d,value:"Pavel Havlíček is a Research Fellow of AMO Research Center.\nHis research focus is on Eastern Europe, strategic communication\nand disinformation as well as civil society.\nHe deals with regulation of social media platforms, digital transparency\nand the Czech and EU approach to it."}]}]},dir:e,path:"\u002Fen\u002Fpanel\u002Fthe-future-of-european-digital-policy\u002Fprofile-havlicek-pavel",extension:f,createdAt:g,updatedAt:"2020-12-05T15:35:57.168Z"},{slug:"profile-pirkova-eliska",title:"Eliška Pírková",image:"pirkova-eliska.jpg",videoDescription:"In recent years, large online platforms with huge market dominance have elevated themselves to the role of online gatekeepers. At the same time, their business models are built on data harvesting without proper safeguards and they do not give users adequate control over their data and the information they receive and impart. Users and public regulators are not in a position to understand the extent to which our data are being used, nor are we able to determine the extent to which automated decision-making is leveraged in the curation or amplification of content. We cannot gauge the impact of these automated processes on our exposure to diverse content and we cannot study or prevent the discriminatory treatment of underrepresented groups.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EThe need for systemic regulation of large online platforms that would be able to provide guarantees of meaningful transparency is justified and necessary. There is an enormous power imbalance between the large platforms and their users. In recent years, continuous scandals and increased media coverage have made it clear to the public that companies exercise this power and make enormous profits without taking sufficient responsibility to safeguard people’s fundamental rights. The DSA legislative package is a unique chance to create a systemic regulation of gatekeeper platforms based on human rights standards, making the rights of users the utmost priority.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EIn my contribution to the panel, I will discuss by what means the EU can meet this mark, specifically focusing on measures enabling users' empowerment and control.
