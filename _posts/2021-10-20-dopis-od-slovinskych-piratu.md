Dear Czech Pirates.


On behalf of the entire Slovene Pirate Party, I would like to express gratitude for hosting our
delegation during our visit of your election campaign.


We would like to give special thanks to all pirates who decided to take their time for us in the
midst of the campaign. We enjoyed being among you, the energy people in your party have
is special and non-replicable anywhere else.

The visit has given us some very useful insights, we were studying your merchandise, your
program, contact campaign organisation and overall messaging, as well as the pirate
newspaper. You have a very unique campaigning style that deviates a lot from standard
election campaigns. We will definitely use the knowledge that we gained on the visit in our
own campaign.

Parliamentary elections in Slovenia are scheduled for June 2022 at the latest. We would be
very glad if we could return the favour and accept your delegation during the last weeks of
our campaign as well.

We would like to express our condolences for how the elections turned out for you, you
spent a lot of effort on the entire campaign and sacrificed your political power to bring down
Babiš and to defend democracy. Nonetheless we firmly believe you will be able to
regenerate after this and set the course anew.

Czech Pirate party is and will remain the main role model for the global pirate movement and
a party to look up to.


We wish you all the best for the future,


Jasmin Feratović
General Secretary of Slovene Pirate Party
